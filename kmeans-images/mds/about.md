#### About this *shiny* App

The idea behind this app is taken from [dsparks' kmeans palette](https://gist.github.com/dsparks/3980277). I just add some features like 3d scatterplot and migrate the code to a shiny app. Feel free to make some comments in the [repository](https://github.com/jbkunst/shiny-apps).

Packages used: shiny, dplyr, jpeg, reshape, ggplot2, scales, threejs.

Code by [Joshua Kunst](http://jkunst.com).
